# Sources for genre taxonomies

AllMusic genres are taken from previous project (parsed with a script
https://github.com/MTG/metadb/blob/master/metadb/scrapers/allmusicgenre.py).

Discogs genres are taken from Discogs-Youtube dataset. They were parsed from the release metadata dump.

Wikipedia genres are semi-manually parsed from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_music_genres_and_styles. Only "Popular" category (popular music) is used for simplicity.
