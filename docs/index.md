## Sonification of the PECMAE prototypes

This site contains sonification of the prototypes obtained with PECMAE models.
Aditionally, we provide baselines samples consisting of a random sample from the training set and sonifacions obtained with an [APNet](https://github.com/pzinemanas/APNet/) model.


``Note: the model PECMAE-5 (10s) is based on a newer autoencoder featuring the same architecture presented in the paper but using a longer context window of 10 seconds. Results suggest that extending the receptive field allows to achieve prototypes that better resemble their classes.``
