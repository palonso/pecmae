title: Prototype EnCodecMAE (PECMAE)
---

This site contains sonification of the prototypes obtained with PECMAE models.
Aditionally, we provide baselines consisting of a random sample from the training set of each dataset and sonifacions obtained with an [APNet](https://github.com/pzinemanas/APNet/) model.


## Updates

- ⚠️  **2024/02/02. Fixed  prototype URLs in GTZAN**

    > By mistake we duplicated the links for prototypes 0 and 1, and they sounded identical. Fixed now

- **2024/01/22. Newer PECMAE model with 10-second context**

    > The sonification results obtained with model PECMAE-5 (10s) are based on a newer autoencoder featuring the same architecture presented in the paper but using a longer context window of 10 seconds.
Results suggest that extending the receptive field allows to achieve prototypes that better resemble their classes.
